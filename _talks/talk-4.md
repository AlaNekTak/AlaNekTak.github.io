We are excited to host the Third Workshop on Social Influence in Conversations (SICon 2025) in Vienna, Austria — SICon is a one-day hybrid event, co-located with ACL. As SI dialogue tasks (negotiation, persuasion, therapy, and argumentation) have recently gained traction, this workshop offers a venue to foster discussion on social influence within NLP while involving researchers from other disciplines — e.g., affective computing and the social sciences.
